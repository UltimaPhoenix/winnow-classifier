# Summary article for entire project (Question Classification and Winnow)

= Abstract =

In this paper we describe an implementation of the winnow algorithm for the problem of the question classification.
The project's aim is to try the accuracy of a Winnow Based Algorithm in Question Classification Problem.


= Introduction =

What is Question Classification? Who know?

 * QA
 * QC
 * online/offline
 * Mistake Bound Model

= Descritpion of the classifier =

The classifier is conforms to the [http://weka.sourceforge.net/doc/weka/classifiers/Classifier.html WEKA Classifier Interface].
The basic feature of the classifier are:
 * Winnow based
 * Online
 * Dynamically class

The structure of the classifier is the following;
the main class is named WinnowClassifier and perform all the feature of a WEKA Classifier.
To satisfy the prerequisite of the Question Classification problem the WinnowClassifier class contains a map of SpecialistCollection object, respectively, one for each category to classify.
A SpecialistCollection is conceptually a set of Specialist that collaborate to classify the instances. The SpecialistCollection makes a positive or negative prediction, that is based on the weights sum of the specialists contained in it.
Th Specialist object contained in the SpecialistCollection, have a weight that raise or decrease every time the prediction is wrong. 


= Experimental result =

All the test are made on macro category of:
 * train_5500.label on training and cross validation
 * TREC_10.label on test validation
To compare our classifier with the default [http://weka.sourceforge.net/doc/weka/classifiers/functions/Winnow.html "winnow Weka"]we have should build a wrapper that encapsulate six instance of the Weka classifier, on for each macro category, this because the winnow algorithm can classify only one category at a time.

== Winnow Weka Collector vs Winnow Classifier ==
~75%

=== Winnow Weka Collector vs Winnow Classifier with more Filter ===
~80%

= Conclusion =

Don't ask us nothing!
